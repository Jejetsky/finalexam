    <p>Everyone needs zoos. Men, women, children, the animals themselves. Everyone benefits. For people, there is the relaxation element of a day at the zoo or aquarium, just visiting all the animals and seeing their day-to-day. For children - the strange and fascinating intrigue of an animal they may or may not have seen before. The ability to learn more about it. Even scientists, zoologists, and veterinarians still have a thing or two to learn. There is just something different about actually seeing an animal in-person versus seeing a still image, video or even livestream. A greater connection to the living being and to nature itself, if you will.</p>

        Imagine this. You've taken a vacation day from work, you have nothing planned for the day. A thought pops into your head, "I haven't been to the zoo in a long time, today seems like a good day for it". You're in the mood for a quiet day, so you pay a visit to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neaq.org">New England Aquarium</a>. You walk about, viewing exhibits, seeing the eels, penguins, turtles and seals. You see parents pointing to various creatures and teaching their children about them. You see kids running around the Giant Ocean Tank trying to follow the rays and sea turtles. You see children point and laugh as one of the penguins did something funny. "Today was a good day. Everyone is having a great time learning and seeing the animals. Even I learned something new today."

    <p>In the world, there exist some species that are able to reproduce asexually, usually plants or insects. It doesnt happen often in vertebrates, and there are only some species that are able to. With how low the chance of this asexual reproduction is, and how much lower the offspring's survival chances are, you can imagine the surprise of New England Aquarium biologists when an anaconda in an all-female exhibit became pregnant and started delivering young. Stillborn young are common when it comes to asexual reproduction, but in this case, two of the anaconda babies survived and are thriving. Biologists ran a DNA test to rule out other possibilities. and confirmed it to be asexual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neaq.org/blog/two-baby-anaconda-born-in-all-female-adult-exhibit/">reproduction</a>.</p>

    <p>Zoos play a beneficial role when it comes to conservation. Many zoos have breeding programs to ensure propogation of certain species, preservation of genetic diversity, and some play a part in reintroducing endangered animals to the wild. Ever wondered why almost every zoo has Ring-Tailed Lemurs? As it turns out, based on an article by Kim Reuter at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.conservation.org/blog/wild-ring-tailed-lemur-population-has-plummeted-95-since-2000/">Conservation.org</a>, wild lemur populations are down roughly 95% since 2000! The abundance of them in captivity is thanks to the conservation and breeding efforts put forth by the worldwide collection of zoos. Cheetahs and Giraffes are in a similar boat to lemurs, not nearly as extreme, but still worrisome.

    <p>Just this December the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neaq.org">New England Aquarium</a> rescued 195 sea turtles from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neaq.org/blog/as-stranding-season-nears-end-sea-turtle-rescues-reach-195/">hypothermia</a>. Sea turtles love to hang around the warm waters of Cape Cod (as do humans), but when water temperatures drop suddenly, some turtles don't have time to react and migrate to warmer waters. As such, they start to get cold and become "cold-stunned". Unable to swim, they wind up on beaches, where the air temperature might be even lower. Volunteers walk the beaches of Cape Cod on the helpful hunt of beached and freezing turtles. They rescue the stranded turtles and bring them to either the New England Aquarium or the Aquarium's Quincy Animal Care Center where they are treated for their hypothermia. The turtles are rescued, rehabilitated, and then released.</p>
